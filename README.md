# PricingModel
#
 - To predict the price of an object, you will have to use all the independent variables. In this case, the ```selling price``` will be our target variable.
 - By using all the other independent variables, when can build a ML Regression Model to predict this selling.
 - In this notebook, Random Forest and Multiple Linear Regressions were tested.(Random Forest is the final model based on the ```r2_score```
    ```MultipleLinearRegression: 0.9144342972228519``` ```RandomForest: 0.9587394387288477```
 - RandomizedSearchCV implemented to tune hyper parameters
 - Parameters from the RandomForest are used to train the model to obtain better precision.
   By using the RF parameters, precision moved from ```0.9427469974559232``` to ```0.958636723655169```
